\chapter{Reconstruction as an Auxiliary Task for Generative Modeling}
\label{chap:chapter2}

\begin{chapterabstract}
	We propose an approach for conditioning a GAN model to reconstuct images from a very sparse set of pixels known beforehand. This approach, based on a Maximum A Posteriori estimation, takes the form of an explicit auxiliary reconstruction task which adds to the GAN objective as an additional loss term. Complemented with the PacGAN variant for training GANs, this approach enables the generation of diverse samples from a sparse pixel map. As opposed to the more classical Conditional GAN approach, this auxiliary task is interpretable and a hyperparameter allows to control the importance of the conditioning in the learning process. We evaluate our approach on the classical MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, as well as a custom-made texture dataset. Finally,  we apply this approach to a task of geostatistical simulation.
