\chapter{Reconstruction as an Auxiliary Task for Generative Modeling}
\label{chap:chapter2}

\begin{chapterabstract}
	In this chapter, we propose an approach for conditioning a GAN model to reconstuct images from a very sparse set of randomly-positioned pixels known beforehand. This approach, based on a Maximum A Posteriori estimation, takes the form of an explicit auxiliary reconstruction task which adds to the GAN objective as an additional loss term. Complemented with the PacGAN variant for training GANs, this approach enables the generation of diverse samples from a sparse pixel map. As opposed to the more classical Conditional GAN approach, this auxiliary task is interpretable and a hyperparameter allows to control the importance of the conditioning in the learning process. We evaluate our approach on the classical MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, as well as a custom-made texture dataset. Finally,  we apply this approach to a task of geostatistical simulation.

 \section{Image Reconstruction with Generative Models}

Image reconstruction is the task of completing an image from a very small subset of the pixels. Such source data can usually be found in domains where the measurement process is very noisy or where measurements are expensive. This task differs from image inpainting since the source data is usually unstructured and very scarce, as in this chapter we will consider randomly scattered measurements of less than a percent of the image. While our discussion focus on image reconstruction, it is noteworthy to mention that this applies to other kinds of signals.

The task of image reconstruction is challenging since very few information is available for use. To overcome this lack of information, generative models such as GANs leverage on existing datasets to learn the distribution of the real images. By conditioning the learned distribution, a GAN could learn to generate an image while enforcing the constraint that the pixels known beforehand must remain similar in the generated image.

Similarly as in the GAN setup, we denote  by $X \in \setX$ a random variable and $x$ its realization. Let $p_X$ be the distribution of $X$ over $\setX$ and $p_X(x)$ be its evaluation at $x$. Similarly $p_{X|Y}$ represents the distribution of $X$ conditioned on the random variable $Y \in \setY$. 

Given a set of images $x \in \setX = [-1, 1]^{n\times p\times c}$  (see Figure \ref{fig:digit}) drawn from an unknown distribution $p_X$ and a sparse matrix  $y \in  \setY = [-1, 1]^{n\times p\times c}$ (Figure \ref{fig:pixelwise_gen}) as the given constrained pixels, the problem consists in finding a generative model $G$ with inputs $z$ (a random vector sampled from a known distribution $p_Z$ over the space $\setZ$) and constrained pixel values $y \in  [-1, 1]^{n\times p\times c}$ able to generate an image satisfying the constraints while likely following the distribution $p_X$ (see Figure \ref{fig:image_completion}).
