Reformulation of CycleGAN as a constrained optimization problem 

Relaxation of the constraints

Ici, exp√©rimenter sur des datasets artificiels ?

\section{Proximal method for non-Euclidean output space}
Travail sur le proximal ?

Envelope theorem application

\section{Application to RGB to Polarimetric domain transfer}

Introduction to polarimetry-specific physical constraints (briefly, no need to write a physics essay)

Reformulation as constraints on the output space

Relaxations : $L_2$ term + rectified term

Dataset, Evaluation

Experiments and results

\section{Conclusion}

Relaxation of the constraints works even when a lot of constraints are applied

The application to the polarimetric dataset works

Future works : using adapted metrics for the non-euclidean outspace
